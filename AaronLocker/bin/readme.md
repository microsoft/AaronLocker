# bin folder

The bin folder exists to store binary data. And scripts related to the type system.

This may include your own C#-based library, third party libraries you want to include (watch the license!), or a script declaring type accelerators (effectively aliases for .NET types)

For more information on Type Accelerators, see the help on Set-PSFTypeAlias
